# .files

These are my dotfiles. Take anything you want, but at your own risk.

It mainly targets macOS systems, but it works on at least Ubuntu as well.

## Installation

On a sparkling fresh installation of macOS:

```bash
sudo softwareupdate -i -a
xcode-select --install
git clone https://github.com/rafaelbeck/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
sh install.sh
```
